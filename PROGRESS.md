## Module 0 detail
Converted every screen (sidebar, mobile nav, Dashboard, New Sale, New Purchase, Sales/Purchase
List, Items, Parties, Payments, Reports incl. all sub-reports, Settings, modals, toasts,
autocomplete dropdown, badges) from the old light `ink`/`brand` custom Tailwind colors to the
real `zinc`/`red` palette specified in the brief. Removed the custom `ink`/`brand` color
definitions from `tailwind.config` entirely — using Tailwind's real built-in scales is more
maintainable than keeping a same-named-but-repointed indirection.
Found and fixed one real bug during verification: two raw `<input>` elements (Discount in New
Sale, Other charges in New Purchase) didn't use the shared `inputCls` and so kept the browser's
white default background even after the retheme — added explicit dark classes to both, plus a
defensive global CSS rule (`input,select,textarea{background-color:...}`) so this class of bug
can't silently recur on any future raw input.
Verified visually in a real Chromium browser (Playwright) against the mock-mode app: Dashboard
incl. low-stock alert, New Sale incl. keyboard-focus ring on a billing-grid cell, Item/Party/
Payment modals, Purchase, Reports incl. Outstanding tab, Settings. Print view intentionally left
light/white (untouched) since it's meant to be printed on paper.

## Notes
- Testing method: mock mode only (localStorage mockServer, IS_GAS=false), verified by opening
  Index.html directly in a browser (Playwright/Chromium) — no Google login is available in this
  environment, so live-Sheet testing is the human's job after each module (see bottom of
  ONESHOT_PROMPT1.md for the exact 3 steps).
